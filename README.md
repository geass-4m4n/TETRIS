# TETRIS





## ABOUT!
The project I intend to build is the famed arcade single player game TETRIS . I intend to savor the original flavor of the game by writing it in C++ using OpenGL-GLFW library and SFML library . The traditional game has some bugs related to the pieces I encounter in the game and I intend to make it flawless by fixing those bugs. It will currently consist of a single level following all the constraints of the original TETRIS GAME . Further levels of varying difficulty will be added to the game after the competition. It also displays the current score of yours and high score mad till the game is running.
